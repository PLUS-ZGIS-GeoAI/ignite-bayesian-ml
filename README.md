# ignite-wildfire-ignition-prediction

#### TODOs

Last status
- I revised the methodology 
- I changed the categorization of features (to make it comparable to IDFS paper MÃ¼ller, Vacik)
- This new categorization method is implemented in uncertainty_quantification_v2
- Next things to do:
    - Writing sections of paper. (Codewise, everything I need for now is finished)
    - Paper methodology model, model evaluation and coefficients analysis!!!! (highest priority before touching the code again)
