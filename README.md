#### TODOs

- Last thoughts:

The target is to communicate uncertainty for transparency:
-	How can we communicate uncertainty in an understandable way?
-	How categorize p-values in danger classes?
-	How to categorize hdi into uncertainty classes?

But also:
- I should log transform some features (e.g. poulation) before training
