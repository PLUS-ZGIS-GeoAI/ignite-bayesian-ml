## Uni TODOs

Last Status: trained first pymc model for ffmc asjustment.

- Train on full training data
- Make those results sense?
- Make prediction on test data.
- How to best visualize results?
- How to derive adjustment values from betas?
- Evaluate events from Mortimer
- Think about how this should be modeled best.
- Train and evaluate baseline model.
- Don't forget documentation

# TODO create full training dataset and save

## Personal TODOs

# TODO Notebook for model training. Create OC-SVM model. Model Evaluation (train eval split by time)

# TODO Create script for inference data creation

# TODO write tests for data validation (feature layers, train and inference)

# TODO create Pipeline for making regular predictions

# TODO make production ready ... (Cloud, Schedule, Tests, CI/CD, Metaflow)
